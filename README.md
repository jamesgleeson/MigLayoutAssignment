The GUI: 

The project selected was to design a GUI using GitHub for a Donkey Sanctuary type database. This GUI was designed in MigLayout. For the layout, we used a combination of text boxes and drop down menus and a large comment area at the bottom for entering in additional comments.
The top left of the GUI is for entering in a new animal and has text boxes for animal type, name, vaccination date, age, microchip number and registration number. The right side is for entering in additional information such as worming status, area found, where the animal came from and whether it is available for homing.
The central Notes section allows the user to enter in additional comments about the animal.
At the bottom is a report generator for generating reports on the status of the animals.
